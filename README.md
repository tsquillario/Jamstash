You will need a Subsonic server to be able to play your own music. Subsonic is a free, web-based
media streamer, providing ubiquitous access to your music. Use it to share your music with friends,
or to listen to your own music while at work. Please see http://www.subsonic.org

## Permissions

* You will have to allow Jamstash to "Access your data on all websites". This is required because
  your Subsonic server could be at any URL `http://*/*` or `https://*/*`. This is somewhat
  misleading, we ask for `*://*/*` access so that developers can make API calls to ANY URL ...

We don't collect any personal data and we don't want access to your data on all websites, we simply
have to use that permission so developers can use the App on all urls.

* I NEVER access, read, modify, store, or transmit your personal data.

* If you want to help star this issue: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=158004

### Setting up your environment
In order to build Jamstash, `npm` is  required. For help installing `npm`, see
<https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>.

Once `npm` is installed, clone the project to your local machine using `git`.

Install the project's dependencies by running `npm install && npx bower install`.

### Development and testing
To start a server that will continuously build and test your code as you work, run `npx grunt
serve`. This will open up a browser window with the built app running in it, as well as a Chrome
browser window that runs unit tests. Whenever you change a file, the application is rebuilt and unit
tests are run. Stop the server with CTRL+C.

To generate test coverage reports, run `npx grunt coverage`. This will run unit tests as you work
and generate a code coverage report. Stop it with CTRL+C.

To do a one-off build of the code, run `npx grunt build`. This will also minify the files for use in
production. At this point, the files in `dist/` can be served up via Apache, Nginx, or any other web
server to provide access to the Jamstash application.

### Version bumps and deployment to GitHub Pages
Typically these tasks will be done by a project maintainer.

Jamstash uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). The following commands can be used to
increment the project version across `package.json`, `bower.json`, and `manifest.json`:
```
npx grunt bump:major
npx grunt bump:minor
npx grunt bump:patch
```

The public changelog is located in `app/common/json_changelog.json`. When bumping the version, make
sure to add any notable user-facing changes in this file.

After bumping the version, modifying the changelog, and committing the updated files, use `git tag
<version>` to tag the commit with the current version.

To deploy the new Jamstash version to GitHub Pages, the current version needs to be built and
committed to the 'gh-pages' branch. The `build-commit.sh` script has been provided to automate this
process. Run `./build-commit.sh --help` for more information.

An example of the entire release process:
```
# bump the version
npx grunt bump:patch

# note changes in the changelog
vim app/common/json_changelog.json

# commit the files
git commit -am "Bump version to v1.2.3"

# tag the commit
git tag v1.2.3

# update the gh-pages branch with the current release
./build-commit.sh v1.2.3

# push the commit and tag to the repo
git push origin master --tags

# push the newly-released version to GitHub Pages to deploy it
git push origin gh-pages
```
