***Permissions**

* You will have to allow Jamstash to "Access your data on all websites". This is required because your Subsonic server could be at any URL `http://*/*` or `https://*/*`. This is somewhat misleading, we ask for `*://*/*` access so that developers can make API calls to ANY URL ...

we don't collect any personal data and we don't want access to your data on all websites, we simply have to use that permission so developers can use the App on all urls.

* I NEVER access, read, modify, store, or transmit your personal data.
